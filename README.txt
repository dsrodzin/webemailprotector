Email address anti-spam protection for your website. 
With 100% satisfaction amongst its users so far we hope you like it too - but please review and leave your comments!

Using WebEmailProtector you can more confidently list email addresses on your website and hide them from being scraped and harvested by spammers and the like. 
This is the strongest email obfuscator available - plugin, module or otherwise, and likely the only one that actually works. 
This is because all others are based on Javascript "encoders" that try to hide your email. 
But, because both the email addresses and the coding scheme are given away by the web page and with the rise of Javascript interpreters, these methods are no longer effective. 
Ours works a different way -> visit www.webemailprotector.com for more information.

So stop spammers, phishing, virus attacks and ID theft perpetrators at source and keep your address private. Simple to use and fully supported.

   WebEmailProtector module (under Input Filters)
